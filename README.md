# IMNAKD

This is intended to be a preliminary. I'm just getting started; so it's more of a project overview. 

You'd think I'd do this privately, but whatever... it's called IMNAKD for a reason!!!!

Hooray for the introduction of new technologies that no one person can follow. We have now the decision to... go with Koa????

Why Koa... cuz Kraken is based on Express and Koa comes from ... the makers of Express. I mean you want to use the ltr K, use the ltr k amiright or amiright? I'd keep the E but... I'm goign to be reinvestigating the DB soon enough. Sigh. I should reallly just install something on my dev server. I'm really intching ot do it. 

TEQUILA!!

Curiousity has me, so this cat has got to lose a life.

ImageMagick is a toy from Apostrophe's CMS sandbox concept. I'll see what I can do with images. 

End result may be a sort of IMAGE Gallery CMS based off of this stack. HRM.

ImageMagick, MongoDB, Node.js, AngularJS, [Koa](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/koa-js-a-future-proof-javascript-middleware-framework/), Dust 

Let us see if it works out. Hyper link included for Koa cuz I needed a reason. 


Got to give it a whirl with the introduction of Kraken and Dust and all. 

Theory, intial -


Install MEAN.IO

Add Koa

Add Dust

Dev starting on testing on debian

then moved to openshift.
