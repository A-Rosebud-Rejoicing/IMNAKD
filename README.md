# IMNAKD

This is intended to be a preliminary. I'm just getting started; so it's more of a project overview. 

You'd think I'd do this privately, but whatever... it's called IMNAKD for a reason!!!!

Hooray for the introduction of new technologies that no one person can follow. We have now the decision to... go with Koa????

Why Koa... cuz Kraken is based on Express and Koa comes from ... the makers of Express. I mean you want to use the ltr K, use the ltr k amiright or amiright? I'd keep the E but... I'm goign to be reinvestigating the DB soon enough. Sigh. I should reallly just install something on my dev server. I'm really intching ot do it. 

TEQUILA!!

Curiousity has me, so this cat has got to lose a life.

ImageMagick is a toy from Apostrophe's CMS sandbox concept. I'll see what I can do with images. 

End result may be a sort of IMAGE Gallery CMS based off of this stack. HRM.

ImageMagick, MongoDB, Node.js, AngularJS, [Koa](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/koa-js-a-future-proof-javascript-middleware-framework/), Dust 

Let us see if it works out. Hyper link included for Koa cuz I needed a reason. 


Got to give it a whirl with the introduction of Kraken and Dust and all. 

Theory, intial -


Install 

ImageMagick (Apostrophe Sandbox reasoning.)

MongoDB (Intuition. Almost always need adatabase.... high end though process not willing to share.)

Node.JS (The whole point of the operation. The ONLY thing I want to stick.)

Angular.JS (Okay; it took me so long to figure out if this is needed or not. It's not needed for me - we're looking at a simple html databinding process that looks similar to what's provided in the ASP.NET environment introduced around 1996... it may have been a decade after that - don't remember it was a long while ago) in which databindings occured at the HTML layer using short tags. Though there're additional explanations of it so... let's download it and figure out the mystery.)

Koa (Chosen over Kraken/Express cuz of who is managing the application(s). See Koa is from the makers of express. As far as I can tell Kraken came from PAYPAL. I'm not 100% on that one I just read it somewhere once upon a time. Never-the-less Kraken relies on Express which relies on the makers of express who are building Koa so Kraken relies on express and express relies on Koa - and I want the originator that uses "ES6". 

Dust (Sneezy is not my name and I don't have allergies. Why not through some pixie dust at JSON and watch him fly. Or maybe I'm just smacking him in the ass with a wet towel. 

Dev starting on testing on debian

then moved to openshift.
