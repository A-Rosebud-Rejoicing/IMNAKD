# IMNAKED

This is intended to be a preliminary. I'm just getting started; so it's more of a project overview. 

You'd think I'd do this privately, but whatever... it's called IMNAKED for a reason!!!!


Curiousity has me, so this cat has got to lose a life.

ImageMagick is a toy from Apostrophe's CMS sandbox concept. I'll see what I can do with images. 

End result may be a sort of IMAGE Gallery CMS based off of this stack. HRM.

ImageMagick, MongoDB, Node.js, AngularJS, Koa, Dust 

Let us see if it works out. 


Got to give it a whirl with the introduction of Kraken and Dust and all. 

Theory, intial -


Install MEAN.IO

Add Koa

Add Dust

Dev starting on testing on debian

then moved to openshift.
